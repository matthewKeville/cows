for event
it's event.offsetX i.e. lowercase offset and capital dimension

there is a discrepancy between the cows underlying cp, and the visual
location that maps to it from the onClick method

If I click the spot of the circle located in the northwest hex, the cow is
clicked. I have fudged some data keeping and point representation. I
will need to restructure this data and the rendering methods to avoid
redudancy and the introduction of more error prone code. I should refactor
all drawing operations to canned Path2D paths, and recalculate only when necessary.
I.e. dynamic elements such as cows. Tiles will never need to have paths recalculated.

event offsetX differs than x
x is the true coordinate of the entire html document ...
