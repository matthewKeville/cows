1. State transition should actualize at the method call.
** This means that when I do move(), the stateCap should be set inside
   move so it can vary depending on the state.
   
   I would like to be able to vary stateCap for move depending on genetics and environment
   Water tiles should take more time to traverse than land

2. When water is deep it should require more energy to idle,
   I want to build a system where the constraints allow the cows to mimic
   semi-realistic actions. It is unrealistic to have no motivation to leave water.
   I can tie this in with water depth, and penalize heavily and idling.

3. For the island generation mode, I need a way to make water tiles farther from land
   deeper than those closer, I can implement I nearest algo which finds the grass tile closest
   to the current tile.
