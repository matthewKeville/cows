for event
it's event.offsetX i.e. lowercase offset and capital dimension

there is a discrepancy between the cows underlying cp, and the visual
location that maps to it from the onClick method

If I click the spot of the circle located in the northwest hex, the cow is
clicked. I have fudged some data keeping and point representation. I
will need to restructure this data and the rendering methods to avoid
redudancy and the introduction of more error prone code. I should refactor
all drawing operations to canned Path2D paths, and recalculate only when necessary.
I.e. dynamic elements such as cows. Tiles will never need to have paths recalculated.

event offsetX differs than x
x is the true coordinate of the entire html document ...

// Request Animation Frame //

1. Capped at the refresh of the display
2. making frames to quickly
   all frames are rendered in about 4ms but tick 500ms
   the way draw(dt) is written , it only gets to timesteps 
   in the first time bucket : tick/animCap*animCycles

3. I need to rethink approach to draw  or
4. change the callback on request animationFrame to spread its frames over
   the tick interval. Something like keeping track of time elapsed since last tick
   , splitting the tick time over the target refresh rate : tick / 60 
   and waiting until time passes each time phase
   tick / 60 , 2*tick / 60 , 3*tick /60 ... tick
